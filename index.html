                    <h3>
                        <p>Father Solanus Casey, a Capuchin Franciscan friar, was born on November 25, 1870 on a farm in western Wisconsin bordering the Mississippi River. His Irish immigrant parents named him Bernard. He was the sixth child in a family
                            of ten boys and six girls. After he left the farm he worked in Wisconsin and Minnesota as a logger, a hospital orderly, a prison guard and a street car operator.</p>

                        <p>When he was 21 working on a street car he saw someone who was drunk assaulting a woman on the street car's tracks. This created in him a sense of wanting to do something to make the world better. This led him to enter St. Francis
                            High School Seminary in Milwaukee to study for the diocesan priesthood. Since he was an English-speaking Irishman studying in a German-speaking school, he had difficulty with his studies. It was recommended that he leave that
                            seminary to enter a religious order. He was invested in the Capuchin Order at Detroit in 1897 and received his religious name of Solanus.</p>

                        <p>Unfortunately for Solanus the Capuchins also were German-speaking; this led him to have more difficulties with his priestly studies. His superiors decided, with his acceptance, that he would be ordained but not allowed to hear
                            confessions nor preach dogmatic sermons. Ordained in 1904, Father Solanus spent 20 years in the New York City area: Yonkers, the Lower East Side and then Harlem.</p>

                        <p>In 1924 he was transferred to St. Bonaventure Monastery in Detroit where he worked for 20 years. In 1945, he returned to New York for one year at St. Michael's in Brooklyn. Then he was assigned to Huntington, Indiana from 1946
                            to 1956. When he was in the last year of his life, he was reassigned to St. Bonaventure in 1956.</p>

                        <p>Father Solanus spent his life in the service of people. At the monastery door, he met thousands of people from every age and walk of life. In time of trouble and sorrow, they sought his prayers and advice.</p>

                        <p>Many people believed he had the gifts of healing and prophecy; they attributed favors to his prayers. He constantly showed his love of God by loving all of Godâ€™s people. However, like his models, Jesus and Francis, he would often
                            say: "I have two loves: the sick and the poor." He was always ready and willing to listen to anyone any time of the day or night. In return he asked people to develop their own spiritual lives by growing in love and God and
                            neighbor, especially by their support for the missions.</p>

                        <p>During his final illness, he remarked: "I'm offering my suffering that all might be one. If only I could see the conversion of the whole world." His last conscious act was to sit up in bed and exclaim, "I give my soul to Jesus
                            Christ." He died in Detroit at the age of 86 on July 31, 1957 and is buried at St. Bonaventure Monastery.</p>



                        <p>The biography of Father Solanus Casey was read during his Beatification on November 18, 2017 at Ford Field in Detroit, MI.</p> -->
